This repository contains Java implementations of various tasks related to loops, classes, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Implemented Features

### 1) Basic Loop Operations
- Print a message.
- Print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Print numbers in reverse order.
- Print odd numbers between 1 and 20.
- Reverse the left and right numbers in a sequence:
  - Example Input: `9` → Output: `4 3 2 1 5 9 8 7 6`
  - Example Input: `13` → Output: `6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 12 11 10 9 8`

### 2) Student Class
- Created a `Student` class.
- Created 5 student objects and stored them in a suitable data structure.
- Calculated the average marks of the students.

### 3) Library System (Using OOP Concepts)
- Implemented classes for a Library with different types of books:
  - Printed Books
  - E-books
  - Audiobooks
- Used **Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation** to manage book types effectively.

### 4) Retail Store Management
- Implemented a `Store` class to manage products like fruits, vegetables, groceries, etc.
- Features include:
  - Adding a product
  - Editing a product
  - Deleting a product
  - Displaying available products (name, price, quantity)

### 5) Number Processing using Loops
- Implemented various loop-based tasks including:
  - Printing a message.
  - Printing numbers from `1 to 10`.
  - Printing numbers in reverse order.
  - Printing all odd numbers between `1 and 20`.
  - Reversing left and right numbers in a sequence using only loops.

### 6) Reverse Left and Right Numbers Using Loops
- Given an input number `N`, split the sequence into two halves and reverse each half.
  - Example:
    - Input: `9` → Output: `4 3 2 1 5 9 8 7 6`
    - Input: `13` → Output: `6 5 4 3 2 1 7 13 12 11 10 9 8`

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac <filename>.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java <classname>
   ```

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Any Java-compatible IDE or terminal
